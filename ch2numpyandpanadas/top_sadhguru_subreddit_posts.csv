This may be diametrically opposite to some moral theories that say the outer and the inner should not touch each other, otherwise you would immediately get corrupted by everything.
You look at one thing as good, something else as bad. You get attached to what you consider as good. You desperately try to avoid what you consider as bad, and of course that will rule you from inside. This is not the way to be. Seeing everything just the way it is – that is the way to be within. If you see something other than what is there, it means you are contaminating the world with your opinions and prejudices.

Creation is made so that you see it the way it is, not to make it the way you want to make it. This is an obscenity that humanity is committing upon the Creator’s creation. Such a magnificent creation – what is there for you to do? Absorb it if you can – nothing more – and even that is not simple because creation is phenomenally multi-tiered. So many phenomena are happening right here – one inside the other, all in one space, all in one time.

Everything that you think is past, everything that you think will be future is right here. If you see everything the way it is, if the whole creation reflects within you, if you can contain creation the way it is within you, you become the very source of creation. That is the way to be, inside and outside.",1645092031.0

Healthy soil is packed with organic (or carbon-based) matter and minerals that become nutrients for plants and microorganisms (living things that can only be seen with a microscope). The mineral nutrients come primarily from weathering rocks and from living and decomposed organic matter, and secondarily from rainfall and interactions between soil organisms and the atmosphere. 

Carbon comes from the dead and living organisms on top of and within the soil. When carbon-based plants and animals die, their bodies decay with the help of soil decomposers, and the carbon moves into the soil. When living plants photosynthesize, they make carbon-based sugars for food. Most of these carbon-based sugars are drawn down into plant roots, while some move out into the soil.

[Life in the Soil](https://youtu.be/XapUm5n1zuM) watch this video for some better perspective..

Imagine soil with no organic content. Which means soil with less fertility. Can you imagine how disastrous it is? Unhealthy soil alone can lead to destruction of the entire ecosystem. And the scientists say, that we have about 40-50 years of agricultural soil left on this PLANET. Isn't it time for us to action?",1644554272.0

This can be a path in itself. The most beautiful expression of this is the Annadanam - the sacred offering of food.” - Sadhguru

Well, Annadanam in Indian culture has been very prominent. Especially during any festivals, or auspicious occasions like birthdays, weddings, etc. Since my birth, every single year, my mother jas ensured that I offer food, either myself or through any institutions like temples to the needy.

Just experiment and see, when you eat vegetarian food in its live form, what a difference it will make. The idea is to eat as much live food as possible – whatever can be consumed in its raw, uncooked form. A live cell has everything to sustain life. If you consume a live cell, you will see the sense of health in your system will be very different from anything that you have known. When we cook food, we destroy the life in it. Eating food after this process of destruction does not give the same amount of life energy to the system. But when you eat live food, it brings a different level of aliveness in you. If one brings in at least thirty to forty percent live food into their diet – sprouts, fruit, and whatever vegetables that can be consumed in a live condition – you will see, it will sustain the life within you very well.

Above all, the food that you eat is life. Other forms of life are giving up their life to sustain ours. If we can eat with enormous gratitude for all of them, then food will behave in a very different way within us.[ A Plant-Based Diet and its Benefits](https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en/wisdom/article/plant-based-diet-benefits?client=sadhguru-app)",1644085791.0

Sadhguru has spoken on the significance & dangers of wearing black, and when we should or shouldn't wear it. 

Right from when I was young, black colour clothes fascinated me. But we were not allowed to buy them by our grandparents. When I started working, I bought many dresses.. black in combo with all sorts of colours. In a week I would wear black at least thrice, and on Saturday it was compulsory for me! Not to mention the number of black T's..

However after I started my Yoga and later on listened to what Sadhguru says about the effect of the black colour and how it affects our psychological and emotional composition, i was shattered. 

With a very heavy heart I started packing my black dresses and put them in a box in my shaft. They are still there! 

How many times I longingly look at them!

In this process of looking for luck and waiting for things to happen, things that they could have easily created for themselves are completely lost. With every aspect of life, it is you who has to make it happen. Your peace and your turmoil is your business. Your sanity and insanity is your business. Your joy and misery is your business. The devil and the god within you is your business.
Instead of allowing your energies to express themselves to their fullest capability, instead of creating the necessary inner and external atmosphere around us where the right kind of situation can happen, we are unfortunately always looking for something else which could make that happen for us.

How you experienced today, from morning to evening, is definitely yours. How much friction you had with people around you simply depends on how insensible you have been in understanding the situations and people around you – their limitations and possibilities within themselves. It is definitely not decided by what lucky charms you may be wearing. It simply depends on how sensibly, intelligently, and with how much awareness you walk and look at life around you.

One day, two men met in the airport. One man was looking truly dejected. So the other man asked, “Why are you like this? What happened to you?”

The first man said, “What should I tell you? My first wife died of cancer. My second wife eloped with my neighbor. My son is in prison because he attempted to murder me. My fourteen-year-old daughter is pregnant. Lightning struck my house. All my shares went bust in the share market today, and my medical report says I have AIDS.”

The other man said, “Wow! What a lot of bad luck for you! Anyway, what do you do? What’s your profession?”

The man replied, “I sell lucky charms.”

It is just that if you are in a certain way, certain things will gravitate towards you. If you are in a certain other way, certain other things will gravitate towards you. If there is a flowering bush and a dry, thorny bush out there, all the bees gravitate towards the flowering bush. The flowering bush isn’t lucky, it just has a fragrance – which you may not be able to see – that is drawing everything towards it. People walk away from the thorny bush because it is creating another kind of situation. Maybe both of them are unconscious of what they are creating but things are happening the way they need to happen.

So, if things are happening great for you and you don’t know why, I would say you are eating stale food. You cooked your meal somewhere else – maybe long ago – and you are still eating good food. But it is stale and getting staler by the day. However, if things are happening well for you and you know why it is happening, that means you cooked your food today, consciously. If things are going really bad for you and you don’t know why, once again you are eating stale food which has turned rotten.",1643418490.0

Even if I lose my track during the day sometime with more work and multiple things to handle I come back to my clarity with a simple chanting called Brahma Nand Swaroopa.

It is comprised of countless species that create a dynamic and complex ecosystem and is among the most precious resources to humans. Increased demand for agriculture commodities generates incentives to convert forests and grasslands to farm fields and pastures. The transition to agriculture from natural vegetation often cannot hold onto the soil and many of these plants, such as coffee, cotton, palm oil, soybean and wheat, can actually increase soil erosion beyond the soil’s ability to maintain itself.

Half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years. In addition to erosion, soil quality is affected by other aspects of agriculture. These impacts include compaction, loss of soil structure, nutrient degradation, and soil salinity. These are very real and at times severe issues.

The effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. It has led to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers, clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species. And degraded lands are also often less able to hold onto water, which can worsen flooding. Sustainable land use can help to reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock, preventing soil degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to desertification.

Can this be done on an individual level? No. We need a global policy level changes where we as citizens demand the governments that we elect to take necessary actions to revitalize soil. Shall we join hands and make this happen?",1643259294.0

Because they said to eat only twice a day, I eat at 12 and at 18.30, is it good?

I do not want to destroy all the romance, but essentially it is happening within you.

It is wonderful that you are experiencing such sweetness of emotion stimulated by someone. You are using the other person as a key to open up an experience within you. But why are you using a key when there is no lock, no door, no barrier of any kind? It is just that you are a push-start machine. If you owned an Ambassador car twenty-five years ago, you would have always parked it on a gradient, because two people had to push it in the morning to get it to start. Nowadays all the cars are self-start. Many of them are remote start. Would you like to upgrade your technology so that you are on self-start?

The Moon continues to play the blushing bride
of showing herself in wax and wane.
Am I missing something!
I squat to touch the ever reliable
Terra firma, a fistful of wet sod.
It all feels the same.
Then I close my eyes as it is the
nature of my tribe to close eyes
when we really wish to see.

Ah' now I see I am lighter by a year.
As the burden of years peel off
I am lighter of the years gone by.
The exhilaration of being closer
to the Destination, the joy of
the journey multiplies.
To Be, to Breathe is Bliss

I used to be a nootropic expert and I can’t wrap my head around not taking supplements such aid to my life, but I need an opinion of someone who has a more holistic approach (Ayurveda for ex).
Besides having the regular ashwaghanda/neem/tumeric/lemon/bilva/holy basil in the morning what could be Sadhguru opinion on taking these supplements/herbs in addition:

Ones I actually take:
- vitamin D3 (in winter no sun)
- L-Carnitine (converts fat into energy)
- Bacopa Monnieri (sattvic herb for brain and memory)
- Zinc (I don’t know about this one, but majority of population is deficient)
- [Detox complex](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07QG457XJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_Q39VXG46BY0BD5PB59ZP)
- Antioxidant: astaxanthin (I don’t know about this one neither)
- Zeolite

Ones I stopped taking:
- Omega 3 (I don’t take this anymore, since I moved to nuts and nuts and nuts, but still opinions?)
- Noopept (boosts bdngf and ngf throught acetylcholine and glutamate, but I don’t think I need external boost anymore)
- Magnesium + Potassium (only in summer I take)
- Probiotics (only when I have problems with stomach, almost never)
- ginko Biloba (too stimulant)
- rhodiola rosea (its great but I’m scared of side effects since it’s too great)

Since then, my life for one year went by so fast with so many changes, so many beautiful beginnings, so many life changing moments, met the most genuine people, and the most important of all - got a living Master, a Guru for myself.
Life transformed in ways beyond my understanding. My life was extremely chaotic before. I just wouldn't know why I was so unhappy and unsatisfied, but now there are so many things to be happy about and so many things to look forward to. The most important thing is to be willing to life. I got a taste of how beautiful life can be if I am willing.

If we are concerned as to what we create in this world, it is extremely important that first we learn to create the right things in our mind. If we do not have the power to keep our minds the way we want, what we create in the world is also going to be very accidental and haphazard.

If you bring your mind to a certain level of organization, your body, emotion, and the fundamental life energies get organized in that direction. Once all these four dimensions of you are organized in one direction anything that you wish happens without even lifting a finger. It would help to assist it with activity, but even without doing any activity you can still manifest what you want, if you organize these four dimensions in one direction and keep it unwavering in that direction for a certain period of time. ",1641575642.0
